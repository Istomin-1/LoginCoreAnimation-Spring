# LoginCoreAnimation-Spring
In this project, a registration screen is presented, which signals the absence of the entered information in the field, and also displays the loading process, all this is implemented using basic animation. When you go to the second screen, the methods and types of animation configured using the Spring framework are shown. The project was created using the CALayer, CAGradientLayer, CAShapeLayer, CABasicAnimation classes, using the Spring library. Also, here are considered how to work with the keyboard, so that it does not close the TextField during input, and it would be possible to hide it using a button.
